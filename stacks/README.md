# Stacks

Stacks are Last in first out

## Functions in a stack

-   `push` for placing data on to a stack
-   `pop` for removing the top element of the stack
-   `peek` for displaying the top element of the stack
-   `length` or `size` for displaying the length of the stack.

The array object in javascript has all the functions for a stack, so we can use array as a stack.
