# Typescript Data Structures and Algorithms.

To make use of this repo,

-   clone the repository to your local system
-   run `yarn install` to install dependencies and devDependencies
-   make sure you have `parcel` installed globally. Run `npm i -g parcel` to install `parcel` globally. Parcel helps us transpile typescript files to javascript
-   to transpile a typescript file to a javascript file, run `parcel ./path-to-file.ts`
-   this creates a `dist/` folder containing the transpiled javascript files.
-   you can open a new terminal tab to run `node ./dist/path-to-javascript-file.js` to run the transpiled javascript file.
